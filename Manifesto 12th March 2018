The intelligence of Dolphins

There are fifty-five species of dolphins. The one which concerns us is the dolphin with a bottle nose.
He can reach 3.50 metres in length, and his weight can go as far as 250 kilogrammes. His brain weighs more than ours;
it is true that, his body being longer than ours, the relationship of the weight of his brain to his length is one for 
the dolphin against 1,2 for us. We have therefore a slight advantage in this respect. But the brain of this dolphin has
the capacity to develop chains of reason and to accumulate knowledge comparable to ours. 
The dolphins possess a true language and manage through conversation among themselves to exchange thoughts similar to ours.
They produce the sounds not with their mouth, but by the blow hole for breathing, which is found at the top of their skull,
and which can be seen to open and close when they speak. Unfortunately, a big part of the sounds which they produce escape us, 
since they are frequencies which for us go from the sonic to the supersonic. 
Moreover, they do not only communicate with men by using the sounds which are audible to the latter. We are able to say, even,
that little by little they learn to speak in a human form because they find some intonations which are close to ours when they
live with us. The rapidity of the vibrations of their voice and of their elocution can admit that they have a speed of thought 
superior to ours. 
To these physical advantages, the dolphins add qualities of good nature and of discernment which should put us to shame. 
They are for man a veneration which induce them not only to help him, but to forgive him everything: never for example, has a 
dolphin done harm to a man voluntarily, even if the latter makes him suffer. At the time when, taken in a net, they are going
to be captured, hardly do they feel the hand of man on them, they surrender to him. However, the dolphins have teeth which put
the sharks to flight.
